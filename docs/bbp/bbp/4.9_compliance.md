4.9 Vendor Performance & Compliance
Template Ref: _analytic_01 (Analytical / Composite Module)
4.9.1 Business Purpose
The Vendor Performance & Compliance module aggregates data across the entire Source-to-Pay cycle to provide:
Performance scoring on:


Cost


Quality


Delivery


Billing accuracy


Service responsiveness


Compliance monitoring on:


Legal/tax documents (GST, registrations, certificates)


Contract adherence


Audit flags


Actionable insights:


Preferred supplier ranking


Watchlist and blacklist candidates


Supplier improvement programs


Goals:
Move from transactional procurement to data-driven supplier management.


Provide objective metrics for:


Allocation of spend


Contract renewal/termination


Negotiation leverage


Risk mitigation.



4.9.2 Conceptual Data Model

4.9.3 UI / UX Requirements
Screen Name(s):
Vendor Performance Dashboard

Vendor Compliance Monitor


Path: Procurement → Vendor Management → Performance & Compliance

By spend


By score

4.9.4 Scoring & Business Rules
Scoring model:
For each vendor & period:
vendor_rating_cost (0–100)


vendor_rating_quality


vendor_rating_delivery


vendor_rating_compliance


vendor_rating_service


Each rating computed from associated metrics, e.g.:
Delivery:


If OTIF ≥ 95% → 90+ score.


If OTIF between 80–95% → 70–90.


If OTIF < 80% → penalized heavily.


Quality:


Based on QC failure rate and return rate.


Billing:


Invoice dispute frequency & variance.


Overall score:
vendor_overall_score =
   cost_weight           * vendor_rating_cost
 + quality_weight        * vendor_rating_quality
 + delivery_weight       * vendor_rating_delivery
 + compliance_weight     * vendor_rating_compliance
 + service_weight        * vendor_rating_service

Classification:
ELITE → score ≥ 90


APPROVED → 75 ≤ score < 90


CONDITIONAL → 60 ≤ score < 75


UNDER_WATCH → 40 ≤ score < 60


BLOCKED_CANDIDATE → score < 40 or critical compliance failures


Exact weight and threshold values are configurable.

4.9.5 Workflow (Analytical & Governance)
This module is mostly batch/scheduled job driven:
Periodic Performance Job (e.g., monthly):


Aggregate data from:


POs (4.3)


GRNs + QC (4.5)


Invoice Matching (4.6)


Returns (4.7)


Payments (4.8)


Compute metrics & scores.


Insert or update vendor_performance_snapshot.


Compliance Monitoring Job:


Evaluate vendor_compliance_record:


Detect expired or soon-to-expire records.


Raise alerts and update statuses.


Governance Actions:


Procurement Head can:


Mark vendor as “Do Not Use / Blocked Candidate”.


Put vendor “Under Watch”.


Approve vendor improvement plan.

Build Steps (for AI / Implementation Engine)
You are building an Analytical/Composite module for a Retail ERP.

Module: Vendor Performance & Compliance
Template: _analytic_01

Requirements:

1) Backend (Django + DRF):

   Models:
   - vendor_performance_snapshot
   - vendor_compliance_record
   - (optional) vendor_performance_event

   Services / Jobs:
   - Periodic job to aggregate KPIs and compute scores per vendor + period.
   - Job to scan and update compliance statuses (valid/expired/etc.).

   APIs:
   - Get vendor performance snapshot list (with filters).
   - Get detailed scorecard for a specific vendor.
   - Get compliance records and alerts.

2) Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind):

   Screens:
   - Vendor Performance Dashboard.
   - Vendor Scorecard:
     - KPIs, charts, events timeline.
   - Compliance Board:
     - Expiring/expired compliance docs.
     - Vendor risk summary.

   Behavior:
   - Interactive filters by period/category/location.
   - Drill-down from dashboard to vendor-level detail.

3) Integration:

   - Read-only integration from transactional modules (4.2–4.8).
   - Optional feedback loop to:
     - Vendor master (flagging under-watch/blocked).
     - RFQ and PO (e.g., prevent awarding to blocked vendors).

4) Security & Roles:

   - Roles:
     - Procurement Analyst
     - Category Manager
     - Procurement Head
     - Compliance Officer (read/write on compliance records)

Ensure that the aggregation logic and KPIs remain consistent with
metrics described in the Vendor Performance & Compliance specification.


4.1 PR → 4.2 RFQ → 4.3 PO → 4.4 ASN → 4.5 GRN+QC → 4.6 Invoice Matching → 4.7 Supplier Returns → 4.8 Payments → 4.9 Vendor Performance & Compliance → 4.10 Config/Masters (which we already partly covered earlier).
