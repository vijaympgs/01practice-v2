Understanding Guardrails
Guardrails typically include:
Rate limits (requests per hour/day)
Token/context limits
Daily usage caps
Concurrent request limits
How to Minimize Issues
1. Subscription Tier
Higher tiers usually have higher limits
Check your tier’s limits after renewal
2. Monitor Your Usage
Check usage in Settings → Account or Usage
Watch for warnings as you approach limits
3. Optimize Your Workflow
Break large tasks into smaller requests
Use focused, specific prompts
Avoid unnecessary re-runs of the same request
4. Best Practices
Use codebase search before asking broad questions
Be specific in your requests
Review code before asking for changes
5. If You Hit Limits
Wait for the reset period (often hourly or daily)
Upgrade your subscription tier if needed
Contact support if limits seem incorrect
After Renewal
Verify your tier and limits in Settings → Account
Confirm any changes to your plan
Check if limits reset immediately or on the next billing cycle
If you share the specific guardrail you hit before, I can suggest targeted ways to avoid it.

Tips for Effective Use
1. Be Specific in Your Requests
Instead of: "fix the bug"
Try: "The login button doesn't work when clicked. Check the onClick handler in Login.jsx"
2. Provide Context
Share relevant file paths
Mention what you've already tried
Include error messages
3. Use Codebase Search
I can search your codebase to understand the structure
This helps me give more accurate answers
4. Break Down Large Tasks
Instead of: "build a complete e-commerce site"
Try: "create a product listing component" → then "add search functionality" → etc.
5. Review Before Accepting
Check the changes I suggest
Test them before moving on
Ask for clarification if something isn't clear
6. Iterate and Refine
If something isn't right, tell me and I'll fix it
We can refine solutions together
